# JSON Parser

This assignment is a part of the CSCI571 Web Technologies course taken at the University of Southern California. In this I learnt how to parse JSON files and display data in tables in a web page. Many validations were taken into account like missing data, different headers, empty json files, invalid json files, no rows, etc.
