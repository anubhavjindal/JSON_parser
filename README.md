# JSON Parser

The project is a part of the course CSCI 571 Web Technologies that I took at the University of Southern California. 

## Overview
It is basically a JSON parser that takes any JSON file from the user and displays the parsed data in form of an HTML table. There are various cases that are handled for parsing the input file like missing data, different headers, missing rows, empty json file, invalid json file, no row in json file, etc.
